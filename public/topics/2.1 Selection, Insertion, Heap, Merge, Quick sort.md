# Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sub-list of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and a sub-list of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sub-list is empty, and the unsorted sub-list is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sub-list, swapping it with the leftmost unsorted element, and moving the sub-list boundary one element to the right.

## How Selection Sort Works

1. **Find the minimum value** in the list.
2. **Swap it with the value in the current position** (this step essentially sorts the element).
3. **Repeat this process** for all the elements until the entire array is sorted.

This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case complexity are of \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of items.

## Selection Sort Algorithm

```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                min_idx = j
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]
```

## Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

### How Insertion Sort Works

1. **Start with the second element** of the array as the first element is considered sorted.
2. **Compare the current element with the one before it** and swap if necessary.
3. **Continue moving backwards** through the array, sorting the rest of the elements by swapping where needed.

This algorithm has an average and worst-case time complexity of \(O(n^2)\).

## Heap Sort

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.

### How Heap Sort Works

1. **Build a max heap** from the input data.
2. **At this point, the largest item is stored at the root of the heap**. Replace it with the last item of the heap followed by reducing the size of heap by 1.
3. **Heapify the root of the tree**.
4. **Repeat the above steps** until the size of the heap is 1.

The time complexity of Heap Sort is \(O(n \log n)\).

## Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.

### How Merge Sort Works

1. **Divide the unsorted list into \(n\) sublists**, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).
2. **Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists** until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

Merge Sort has a predictable time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).

## Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array of data into smaller arrays. A large array is partitioned into two arrays, one of which holds values smaller than the specified value, say pivot, based on which the partition is made and another array holds values greater than the pivot value.

### How Quick Sort Works

1. **Pick an element from the array as the pivot** (usually the middle or the last element).
2. **Partition the other elements into two sub-arrays** according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
3. **The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively**.
4. **Combine the pivot back into the array** after the sub-arrays have been sorted.

The average and worst-case time complexities of Quick Sort are \(O(n \log n)\) and \(O(n^2)\), respectively.

These algorithms are fundamental for understanding sorting mechanisms and are a starting point for learning more complex data structure and algorithm concepts.

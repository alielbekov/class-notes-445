# MST: Prim and Kruskal (21)

A **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a weighted graph is a subset of the edges that connects all vertices in the graph without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

MSTs are crucial in various applications, such as designing networks (like telecommunications, water supply, and electrical grids) where the goal is to connect a set of points at the minimum cost.

## Kruskal's Algorithm

Kruskal's algorithm is a popular method to find the MST of a graph. It works as follows:

1. **Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.**
2. **Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If not, include it in the MST.**
3. **Repeat step 2 until there are `(V-1)` edges in the MST, where `V` is the number of vertices in the graph.**

Kruskal's algorithm uses the Disjoint Sets data structure to keep track of the vertices that are already included in the MST to ensure no cycles are formed.

### Algorithm Complexity

The time complexity of Kruskal's algorithm is `O(E log E)` or `O(E log V)`, where `E` is the number of edges, due to the sorting of the edges and operations on the Disjoint Set.

## Prim's Algorithm

Prim's algorithm is another popular algorithm to find the MST of a graph. Unlike Kruskal's, which works on the graph as a whole, Prim's algorithm grows the MST one vertex at a time. It works as follows:

1. **Start with an arbitrary vertex as the MST.**
2. **At each step, add the cheapest edge from the tree to a new vertex, until all vertices are included in the tree.**

Prim's algorithm can be implemented efficiently using a priority queue to select the minimum weight edge at each step.

### Algorithm Complexity

The time complexity of Prim's algorithm depends on the data structures used for the priority queue. It is `O(E + V log V)` with a binary heap and `O(E log V)` with a Fibonacci heap.

## Comparison of Kruskal's and Prim's Algorithms

- **Kruskal's algorithm** is more suitable for sparse graphs where the number of edges `E` is much less than `V^2`.
- **Prim's algorithm** can be more efficient for dense graphs, where `E` is close to `V^2`, especially when implemented with a Fibonacci heap.

Both algorithms are greedy algorithms and ensure a minimum spanning tree at the end of execution. The choice between Kruskal's and Prim's algorithm often depends on the specific details of the application, such as the graph's density and the data structures used.

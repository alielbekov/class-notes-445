# Divide and Conquer, Recurrences and Data structures (4, 10)


Divide and Conquer is a fundamental algorithm design paradigm that solves a problem by dividing it into smaller sub-problems, solving the sub-problems recursively, and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem.

## Key Steps in Divide and Conquer

1. **Divide**: Break the problem into smaller sub-problems of the same type.
2. **Conquer**: Solve each sub-problem recursively. If the sub-problem sizes are small enough, solve the problems in a straightforward manner.
3. **Combine**: Combine the solutions of the sub-problems into a solution for the original problem.

## Example: Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a classic example of divide and conquer. It divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and merges the sorted halves.

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    ## DO SOMETHING HERE
```

# Recurrences

Recurrences are equations or inequalities that describe a function in terms of its value on smaller inputs. They are often used to express the running time of divide-and-conquer algorithms.

## Solving Recurrences

- **Substitution Method**: Guess the form of the solution, then use mathematical induction to find the constants and prove the solution.

- **Recursion Tree Method**: Convert the recurrence into a tree where each node represents a cost. Summing the costs gives the total cost.

- **Master Theorem**: Provides a direct way to get the asymptotic analysis of recurrences of the form \(T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)\), where \(a \geq 1\), \(b > 1\).

# Data Structures

Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

## Fundamental Data Structures

- **Arrays**: A collection of elements identified by index or key.

- **Linked Lists**: A linear collection of data elements, called nodes, where each node points to the next node by means of a pointer.

- **Stacks and Queues**: Collections that allow insertion and removal of elements in a particular order.

- **Trees**: A data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children, represented as a set of linked nodes.

- **Graphs**: A collection of nodes connected by edges.

## Choosing the Right Data Structure

The choice of data structure depends on the operations that need to be supported and the efficiency required for these operations (like searching, insertion, deletion, etc.).

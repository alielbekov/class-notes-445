# Huffman encoding (15)

Huffman Encoding is a widely used method for lossless data compression. The algorithm was developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Ph.D. student at MIT in 1952. It's based on the frequency of occurrence of a data item (character in strings, pixel intensity in images, etc.). The main idea is to use variable-length codes for encoding the input characters, where shorter codes are used for more frequent characters, and longer codes are used for less frequent characters. This approach ensures that the overall size of the compressed data is minimized.

## How Huffman Encoding Works

1. **Create a leaf node for each unique character** and build a min heap of all leaf nodes (Min Heap is used as a priority queue. The node with the lowest frequency is given the highest priority).

2. **Extract two nodes with the minimum frequency** from the min heap.

3. **Create a new internal node** with a frequency equal to the sum of the two nodes frequencies. Make the first extracted node as its left child and the other extracted node as its right child. Add this node to the min heap.

4. **Repeat steps 2 and 3** until the heap contains only one node. The remaining node is the root node and the tree is a Huffman tree.

## Building the Huffman Tree

- Starting from the Huffman tree root, traverse the tree to assign codes to each character. Traversing left adds a '0' and traversing right adds a '1'. The codes assigned to the leaf nodes form the Huffman codes for the characters.

## Properties of Huffman Codes

- **Prefix Property**: No code is a prefix of another. This property of Huffman codes makes decoding efficient and uniquely decodable.

- **Optimality**: Among the methods of creating a prefix code, Huffman encoding is optimal, meaning no other prefix code will produce a smaller output for the same input frequencies.

## Huffman Encoding Algorithm

```python
# Assume 'frequency' is a dictionary with characters as keys and frequencies as values
def huffman_encoding(frequency):
    heap = [[weight, [symbol, ""]] for symbol, weight in frequency.items()]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    while len(heap) > 1:
        lo = heapq.heappop(heap)
        hi = heapq.heappop(heap)
        for pair in lo[1:]:
            pair[1] = '0' + pair[1]
        for pair in hi[1:]:
            pair[1] = '1' + pair[1]
        heapq.heappush(heap, [lo[0] + hi[0]] + lo[1:] + hi[1:])
    return sorted(heapq.heappop(heap)[1:], key=lambda p: (len(p[-1]), p))

# Longest common subsequence (14)

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is a classic algorithmic challenge in the field of computer science, primarily concerning sequences, strings, or arrays. It is widely covered in fundamental texts on algorithms, including Thomas H. Cormen's renowned book, "Introduction to Algorithms." The LCS problem involves finding the longest subsequence present in all given sequences without disturbing the order of characters. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. The LCS problem is a favorite in dynamic programming, an area of computer science that solves problems by combining the solutions to subproblems.

## Understanding LCS with an Example

Before diving into the algorithm, let's understand LCS through a simple example:

- Consider two strings: `X = "AGGTAB"` and `Y = "GXTXAYB"`.
- The longest common subsequence in these strings is "GTAB", which has a length of 4.

## Algorithm Overview

The LCS algorithm uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the longest subsequence common to all sequences. The basic idea is to build a table that stores lengths of the longest common suffixes of substrings of the given sequences up to a certain length.

## Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Initialization**: Create a 2D array `L[][]` where `L[i][j]` stores the length of LCS of the strings `X[0..i-1]` and `Y[0..j-1]`. Note that `i` and `j` are used to iterate over `X` and `Y`, respectively.

2. **Filling the Table**:
   - If `X[i-1] == Y[j-1]`, then `L[i][j] = L[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
   - Else, `L[i][j] = max(L[i-1][j], L[i][j-1])`.

3. **Tracing the LCS**: Starting from `L[m][n]` (where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `X` and `Y`), trace back the table to construct the LCS.

## Pseudocode

```plaintext
LCS-Length(X, Y)
1. m = length[X]
2. n = length[Y]
3. Let L[m+1, n+1] be a new table
4. for i = 0 to m
5.     L[i][0] = 0
6. for j = 0 to n
7.     L[0][j] = 0
8. for i = 1 to m
9.     for j = 1 to n
10.        if X[i-1] == Y[j-1]
11.            L[i][j] = L[i-1][j-1] + 1
12.        else
13.            L[i][j] = max(L[i-1][j], L[i][j-1])
14. return L[m][n]
```

## Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(mn)\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are the lengths of the two sequences. The space complexity is also \(O(mn)\) due to the storage requirements of the 2D array.

## Application

The LCS problem has numerous applications, including in bioinformatics for DNA sequencing, text diffing tools for version control systems, and in natural language processing for detecting similarities between texts.

By breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems, dynamic programming provides a powerful approach to solving complex challenges such as finding the longest common subsequence. This methodology, exemplified in the LCS problem, is a cornerstone in the design of efficient algorithms.

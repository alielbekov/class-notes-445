# Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sub-list of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and a sub-list of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sub-list is empty, and the unsorted sub-list is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sub-list, swapping it with the leftmost unsorted element, and moving the sub-list boundary one element to the right.

## How Selection Sort Works

1. **Find the minimum value** in the list.
2. **Swap it with the value in the current position** (this step essentially sorts the element).
3. **Repeat this process** for all the elements until the entire array is sorted.

This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case complexity are of \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of items.

## Selection Sort Algorithm

```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                min_idx = j
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]

# SSSP, APSP (22,23)


1. **Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP):**
   SSSP refers to finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. The problem is commonly solved using algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm. 

   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** This algorithm works for graphs with non-negative edge weights and finds the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices. It maintains a set of vertices whose shortest distance from the source vertex is already known and continually expands this set by considering the closest vertex that hasn't been processed yet.

   - **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Unlike Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford can handle graphs with negative edge weights (as long as there are no negative cycles). It iterates over all edges multiple times, relaxing them each time, which ensures that the shortest path distances are iteratively improved until convergence.

1. **All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP):**
   APSP involves finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. There are various algorithms to solve this problem efficiently.


      
   - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** This dynamic programming algorithm efficiently computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It works for both positive and negative edge weights (again, as long as there are no negative cycles). The algorithm builds up a matrix where each entry represents the shortest distance between the corresponding pair of vertices.

## Class Notes

Approach(recursive): If the shortest path has a solution that goes from Node I to Node J(m edges), then we can remove the last node and create another shortest path from I to K (m-1 edges).

To find app pairs shortest path, we are going to initialize a matrix and update it over and over until we reach the desired values. To update from one matrix to the next one, we are going to use Extend(Matrix_i, Weights_s) that returns Matrix_i+1.

## Summary
In summary, SSSP deals with finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices, while APSP deals with finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph. These algorithms are fundamental in graph theory and have numerous applications in various fields such as network routing, transportation planning, and social network analysis.
